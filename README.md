# BigIdeaLab
This is the lab exercise of CMPINF0010


## Getting Started
1. You'll need an environment ~~(maybe Jupyterhub)~~ to open the Untitled.ipynb file and run the python program.
2. Type in `git clone git@github.com:aripnokihs/BigIdeaLab.git` to your terminal and hit enter
3. You'll see a folder named BigIdeaLabn in the file explorer.
4. Double click the folder and you'll see the contents.
5. Launch the `Untitled.ipynb` notebook.

## Usage
Our python program takes the users name and age. After that, it gives feedback, greeting the user. The format is:
```
Your age is x.
Your name is xxx.
```
